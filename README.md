NLP702 Project - Instructing Generative Models for the Task of Arabic Question Answering (Code to be Uploaded)

This course project focuses on evaluating dif-
ferent models for question answering in Ara-
bic, specifically using AraGPT2 and mGPT
as the models for evaluation. The project em-
ploys manual evaluation, following a similar
approach as the self-instruct paper, to rank the
quality of the modelsâ€™ output. The evaluation
aims to assess the performance of AraGPT2
and mGPT in generating accurate and contex-
tually relevant answers to questions in Arabic.
The results of the evaluation will provide in-
sights into the strengths and weaknesses of
these models for question answering in Ara-
bic, and contribute to the body of knowledge
in natural language processing and Arabic lan-
guage processing.
